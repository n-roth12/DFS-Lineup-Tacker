to run test file and show coverage data:
    pipenv run coverage run -m unittest LineupTests.py LineupOptimizerTests.py
    pipenv run coverage report

run tests from "/Users/nolanroth/Desktop/Projects/DFS-Lineup-Tracker/flask_api/api/controllers"
    because relative imports aren't working when I want to import across modules for the tests
    example: "python -m unittest tests/LineupBuilderSlotTests.py"
