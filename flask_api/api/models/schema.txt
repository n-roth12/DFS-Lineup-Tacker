Scrape point projections -> save in its own collection?
...wait... 
Get draftGroup from draftkings API -> pair them with their projections -> save draftGroup in Collection
Create current week config Collection: stores the current week and draftgroup ids
      -> we can change this each week, then any changes to this causes us to refetch current draftgroups
